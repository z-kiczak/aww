## Additional Information

C is a procedural programming language with a static system that has
the functionality of structured programming, recursion, and lexical
variable scoping. C was created with constructs that transfer well to
common hardware instructions. It has a long history of use in programs
previously written in assembly language.

The C programming language is a procedural and general-purpose
language that provides low-level access to system memory. A program
written in C must be run through a C compiler to convert it into an
executable that a computer can run. Many versions ofÂ Unix-based
operating systems (OSes) are written in C and it has been standardized
as part of the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX).
